# Multicelluar-AI
A follow up and companion piece to AI Village. In the steps to create true AI. This is the research into the ability to replicate a singular intelligence through co-operation in AI

## The Goal
Use the core of AI Village to create groups of AI which are mutually beneficial to eachother to see whether they can survive through co-operation in an external environment. 

## Limiting Factors 
1. The AI implemented must be True AI based on AI Village. AI that support contiuous learning through interactions
2. The AI cannot learn in an environment together

## The Proposed Method

Create roles and have AI train in each of these roles on their own prior to introduction into the co-operative environment.
